# App Description

The app is an interactive flashcard system designed to enhance learning and retention. Users can navigate through a series of questions and answers displayed on digital flip cards. Each card can be flipped to reveal the answer, and the app includes several functionalities to facilitate learning:

- **Flipping the Card:** Users can tap on a flashcard to flip it and view the answer on the back. This action is animated for a smooth and engaging user experience.
- **Shuffling:** A shuffle button allows users to randomize the order of the flashcards. This feature uses the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to ensure a fair and thorough shuffling of the cards, providing a varied learning sequence each time.
- **Next and Previous Buttons:** Navigation buttons enable users to move forward and backward through the deck of flashcards. This allows for easy review and repetition of specific questions as needed.
- **Responsive Design:** The app adapts to both portrait and landscape orientations, ensuring optimal usability across various devices, including those with notches or screen obstructions.

This app offers an intuitive and interactive way for users to engage with educational content, making learning more dynamic and accessible.

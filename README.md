\section\*{App Description}

The app is an interactive flashcard system designed to enhance learning and retention. Users can navigate through a series of questions and answers displayed on digital flip cards. Each card can be flipped to reveal the answer, and the app includes several functionalities to facilitate learning:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Flipping the Card:} Users can tap on a flashcard to flip it and view the answer on the back. This action is animated for a smooth and engaging user experience.
\item \textbf{Shuffling:} A shuffle button allows users to randomize the order of the flashcards. This feature uses the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to ensure a fair and thorough shuffling of the cards, providing a varied learning sequence each time.
\item \textbf{Next and Previous Buttons:} Navigation buttons enable users to move forward and backward through the deck of flashcards. This allows for easy review and repetition of specific questions as needed.
\item \textbf{Responsive Design:} The app adapts to both portrait and landscape orientations, ensuring optimal usability across various devices, including those with notches or screen obstructions.
\end{itemize}

This app offers an intuitive and interactive way for users to engage with educational content, making learning more dynamic and accessible.
